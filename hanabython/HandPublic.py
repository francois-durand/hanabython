    The "public" part of a hand.

    An object of this class represents what is known by all players, including
    the owner of the hand.

    We use the same convention as in Board Game Arena: newest cards are on the
    left (i.e. at the beginning of the list) and oldest cards are on the right
    (i.e. at the end of the list).

    Basically, a HandPublic is a list of CardPublic objects.

    :param Configuration cfg: the configuration of the game.
    :param int n_cards: the number of cards in the hand. N.B.: this parameter
        is mostly used for examples and tests. In contrast, at the beginning of
        a game, the hand should be initialized with 0 cards, because cards will
        be given to the players during the initial dealing of hands.
