class PlayerBase(Player):
    """
    A player for Hanabi with basic features.

    This class is meant to serve as a mother class for most AIs and interface
    for human players. It provides all basic features, such as keeping
    track of the number of cards in the draw pile, the cards in the other
    players' hands, the clues given, etc.

    Note that all the variables are "personal" to this player: the Game does
    not share access to its internal variables with the players.

    :param str name: the name of the player.

    :var list player_names: a list of string, each with a player's name. By
        convention, the list is always rotated to that this player has
        position 0, the next player has position 1, etc.
    :var int n_players: the number of players.
    :var Configuration cfg: the configuration of the game.
    :var Board board: the board.
    :var DrawPilePublic draw_pile: the draw pile.
    :var DiscardPile discard_pile: the discard pile.
    :var int n_clues: the number of clues left.
    :var int n_misfires: the number of misfires (initially 0).
    :var int hand_size: the initial hand size.
    :var list hands: a list of Hand objects. The hand in position 0,
        corresponding to this player, is never updated because the player does
        not know what she has.
    :var list hands_public: a list of HandPublic objects. This allow the player
        to keep track, not only of her own clues, but also of the clues given
        to her partners.
    :var int remaining_turns: the number of remaining turns (once the draw pile
        is empty, in the normal rule for end of game). While the draw pile
        still contains cards, this variable is `None`.
    :var bool dealing_is_ongoing: True only during the initial dealing of
        hands. Avoid useless verbose messages in the recent events.
    :var str recent_events: things that happened "recently" (typically, since
        this player's last turn).
    :var int display_width: the width of the display on the terminal (in number
        of characters).
